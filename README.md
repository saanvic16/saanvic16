# 👋 Hi, I'm Saanvi!
I'm a Computer Science student at NJIT’s Albert Dorman Honors College, with a strong interest in AI, data science, and educational technology. I love using code to uncover patterns and solve meaningful problems. Through research, projects, and programs like Break Through Tech, I'm growing my skills and ready to make an impact in the industry.

## 🎯 Featured Project: Churn Classifier  
[🔗 Churn Classifier](https://github.com/saanvic16/My-Cornell-Portfolio)

Built a logistic regression model to predict customer churn using a telecommunications dataset.

**Tools:** `Python`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`  
**What I Did:**
- Developed a machine learning pipeline from scratch: data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Applied L2 regularization via hyperparameter tuning (`C` parameter) to improve generalization.
- Evaluated performance using `log loss` and `accuracy`; observed consistent accuracy (71%) across C values.
- Visualized impact of regularization on performance using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

📊 *Takeaway:* Built a clear understanding of model tuning trade-offs and improved interpretation of ML metrics.  
🧠 *Next step:* Explore ensemble methods and compare performance to baseline logistic regression.

## 🌟 Hackathon Highlight: SafePath (HackPrinceton)  
[🔗 SafePath](https://github.com/saanvic16/HackPrinceton)

**SafePath** is an intelligent safety and assistance system for elderly individuals with cognitive decline.

**Tools:** `React Native`, `Firebase`, `Google Maps API`, `Gemini API`, `Auth0`  
**What I Did:**
- Built an app with facial recognition to help patients identify people around them.
- Implemented geofencing alerts using live location data to notify caretakers when a patient leaves a safe zone.
- Enabled account setup and image uploads by caretakers, and integrated real-time SMS alerts for emergencies.
- Integrated Gemini AI for natural chatbot interaction tailored to the elderly experience.

🔍 *Challenges:* Optimizing facial recognition under different lighting, integrating APIs smoothly, and ensuring real-time geolocation updates.  
💡 *Next step:* Expand features to include wearables and health monitoring for vitals.
